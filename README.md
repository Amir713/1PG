# 1PG Demo
This is a demo of [1PG](https://github.com/theADAMJR/1PG) and was made during a [YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuJjkD8zKVI) which is a foundation for an upcoming udemy course.

Make a file `config.json`:
```json
{
  "mongoURI": "mongodb://localhost/1PG-Demo",
  "token": "NzQwNDkyODIwNTA2MzQ1NTE0.Xypzrg.KPkleOQoytvih4lLlWgMfv7JY2c"
}
```

## Notes
### Make sure `config.json` is in `.gitignore`.
This will help secure your bot token, and make sure your bot does not get hacked.
